1 CONT Notes from Frances Fennessy
1 CONT I found two birthdates for Alice Duane. The 1900 U.S. census and Walter Powers birth certificate says she was born in F
1 CONC ebruary of 1874. Although I received baptismal certificates for 5 of her 6 siblings from parish of Ardfinnan, Tipperar
1 CONC y County, Ireland, the priest could not locate one for her. She was the oldest child, so since her parents were marrie
1 CONC d in April of 1869, I've guessed that the 1870 date is correct.
1 CONT Her brothers and sisters were baptised in the diocese of Lismore, parish of Ardfinnan, her parents were living in Brick
1 CONC , Knocklofty, on the estate of Lord Donoughmore. Her letter to her son, Walter,  states that the cottage at Brick was b
1 CONC uilt for Grandpa (her father) by Lord Donoughmore. 
1 CONT In 1900 she was living at 713 2nd Avenus, New York City.
1 CONT She immigrated with her parents and her siblings in 1884 to New York City. he always told the story of how a whale hi
1 CONC t the ship they were on, damaging it, and they limped into New York harbor.
1 CONT She also remembered the blizzard of 1888 (March 11).
1 CONT From her obituary:
1 CONT  
1 CONT Powers' Mother Buried Monday
1 CONT Mrs Alice Powers, mother of Sergeant Walter Powers, of the Port Washington police department, passed away at her home i
1 CONC n Brooklyn last Friday, in her 68th year. She was seriously injured in a fall last November which was the direct caus
1 CONC e of her death. She is survived by two sons, Walter and Russell, and two daughters, Edna and Helene, also by two sister
1 CONC s, Miss Nellie A. Duane and Mrs Harry McNiece of Jackson Heights.

1 CONT This was Mark's eulogy, composed by three of his sisters.
1 CONT Mark T Fennessy
1 CONT  
1 CONT Mark lived exactly the way he wanted. He created a distinct path, vibrating with enthusiasm and excitement about what h
1 CONC e could create and how he felt, and he was happy with that. Meeting new friends and discussing life were always a big p
1 CONC art of his travels.
1 CONT He hitch hiked across the country, years ago, with $ 0.17 in his pocket. People he met along the way took him in, fed h
1 CONC im, gave him a ride to the next highway-wishing him well and glad they could help him.
1 CONT Mark was an avid bicyclist so that he could stop to enjoy nature's sanctuaries along the way and so he could keep his b
1 CONC ody strong and healthy. The beauty and tranquility of nature nourished him. He spent as much time as he could in Nature
1 CONC 's company. Though Mark wanted few amenities for himself, he worked hard to raise money through the New Haven Communit
1 CONC y Service agency for those less fortunate who needed financial and emotional help.
1 CONT Mark was to be envied for his strong sense of self. No matter what he said or did, he did it with sincerity and convict
1 CONC ion. Mark and a strong faith - in his friends and families and in himself, and the quality of his art work.
1 CONT Being a member of a large family was comforting to Mark. He received unconditional love from many people even when we d
1 CONC id not always keep in constant touch with each other.
1 CONT In the last several years, Mark's spriritual life was very important to him. Healings, miracles and the afterlife enter
1 CONC ed into his conversations. If he knew a friend or relative was sick, he would offer and give spiritual healings. The af
1 CONC terlife for Mark, was to be a time of celebration -- a return to home, to the source that inspired him throughout his l
1 CONC ife.
1 CONT If we were to describe Mark simply - it would be - Mark was a caring, thought-provoking, enthusiastic and creative pers
1 CONC on. Mark had a gift of seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary, the desire to share that with other people.
1 CONT We respected and admired the contribution Mark made to each of our lives, and we will miss him most because we loved hi
1 CONC m.

1 CONT Childhood
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick attended elementary school in Dorchester. He describes it as being ‘across the street’ from the Oliver Wendel
1 CONC l Holmes school. This was likely the Samuel de Champlain School at 22 School Street. He recalls the swings had seats ma
1 CONC de of 1” thick pine boards and hung by heavy chains. He was hit in the head by these swings more than once. During WW I
1 CONC I the lawns of the school were converted to Victory Gardens. He attended Oliver Wendell Holmes School for 7th to 9th gr
1 CONC ade, at 40 School St.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick worked as assistant to the milk man when the family lived in Dorchester. The milk cart was horse drawn, and th
1 CONC e horse knew the route. Patrick and the driver would deliver two streets worth of milk and then meet the horse and wago
1 CONC n down the street. This was around 1938-1940, and Patrick was paid in milk.
1 CONT
1 CONT The family lived at 10 Harvard Ave, in a first floor apartment.  At first they were going to rent a 3rd floor apartment
1 CONC , but Peggy and Marion objected.
1 CONT
1 CONT Maurice Spillane gave Patrick a standard gauge train set. This was quite large and when set up the train rain through f
1 CONC our rooms in the apartment. These model train tracks were originally set in a concrete cellar floor in home where Mauri
1 CONC ce worked.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick had a job delivering newspapers when the family lived in West Roxbury -- the Boston Globe. Some of Dads custome
1 CONC rs wanted the Boston Post instead, so Dad worked out a swap of Globe for Post at the store on Mt Vernon and Centre Stre
1 CONC et -- so his customers got just what they wanted.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick worked at Harvard Medical School for a year when he was 17. He recalls it as an interesting job, slicing up cad
1 CONC avers to train medical students.

1 CONT Automobiles
1 CONT
1 CONT During the late 1940s Patrick would drive his mother into the Market District every Saturday for food shopping. When Pa
1 CONC trick was driving a car with a rumble seat they would fill the rumble seat with food on the drive home.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick’s first car was a 1933 Plymouth Coupe with a rumble seat. The rumble seat would not lock shut, and it would fli
1 CONC p open during a quick start.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick drove a 1939 Chevy for a while, borrowed from his brother John Terence.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick owned a 1942 Chrysler Town and Country sedan -- made of wood. The trunk lid was made of wood and was so heavy t
1 CONC here were two gas cylinders to lift it and hold it up.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick owned a 1961 Lincoln sedan when the family lived in Whitemarsh, Pennsylvania. This car had rear doors that open
1 CONC ed towards the front - known as suicide doors. This car was so bad that it convinced him to never buy another Ford prod
1 CONC uct.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick owned a late 1940s Dodge sedan, with the spare tire mounted on the trunklid. This was added by Patrick. The tir
1 CONC e was intended to be stored in the trunk, but Patrick mounted it on the outside.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick owned a 1939 Buick Model 40 sedan. The family (especially Sheila Fennessy Burke) referred to this car as ‘Methu
1 CONC selah.’ Patrick owned this car until 1986, although it had not run in decades.
1 CONT
1 CONT Patrick’s first new car was a black 1954 VW Beetle, which cost $1495. He purchased it in Massachusetts -- the only loca
1 CONC l dealership was way out on Route 128. He added seat belts to the car while living in Arizona. Just days later he start
1 CONC ed to drive to Boston, and while in Illinois he was involved in an accident where another driver t-boned his VW Beetle
1 CONC . The drivers seat was smashed, so Patrick moved the passenger seat into place and completed the drive. Patrick attribu
1 CONC tes his survival to the seat belts he had just installed.
1 CONT
1 CONT In 1956 he worked for National Company, and was transferred to work in the UK. He sold his 1954 Beetle, but before th
1 CONC e move the contract was cancelled and so was the move to the UK. Patrick purchased a replacement vehicle - a dark blu

1 CONT MATADOR and the Era of Winged Missiles
1 CONT http://www.fas.org/spp/military/program/6555th/6555C2-1.htm
1 CONT
1 CONT Though the Army's BUMPER launches at Cape Canaveral were followed by the first launch of a REDSTONE ballistic missile i
1 CONC n late August 1953, aerodynamic or "winged" missiles dominated the Cape's launch schedule for most of the 1950s. That d
1 CONC ecade witnessed the introduction of the MATADOR, SNARK, BOMARC, NAVAHO and MACE aerodynamic missiles, among which the M
1 CONC ATADOR, with over 280 launches to its credit, stood out as the most-launched missile of its era. The MATADOR was also t
1 CONC he Cape's first full-fledged weapon system program and its initial deployment overseas included military launch crews t
1 CONC rained by the 6555th Guided Missile Squadron at Cape Canaveral. Follow-on testing of the missile provided refinements i
1 CONC n its performance as well as realistic training for several MATADOR squadrons under Tactical Air Command (TAC). As a di
1 CONC rect descendant of the MATADOR, the MACE benefited from the "lessons learned" during MATADOR R&D testing in the 1950s
1 CONC . Ultimately, the MATADOR had a profound impact on the 6555th's organization, manpower and "blue suit" launch tradition
1 CONC s.1
1 CONT Under the terms of a missile contract, the contractor was responsible for development of a weapon system based on ARDC-
1 CONC approved technical requirements. Once a missile program reached the Cape, the Air Force Missile Test Center (AFMTC) wa
1 CONC s charged with acquiring and recording data to confirm those technical requirements were being met. Missile tests on th
1 CONC e Eastern Test Range focused on missile performance first, but they soon provided an opportunity for military participa
1 CONC tion in launch operations. Like its predecessors at Eglin, Holloman and Patrick, the 6555th Guided Missile Wing was giv
1 CONC en the pivotal role of observing the contractor's operations and analyzing the results of each test. This function wa
1 CONC s designed to minimize additional validation launches, since military witnesses could confirm the contractor's complian
1 CONC ce with basic test objectives during the R&D portion of a missile program. With regard to "operational suitability," AF
1 CONC MTC planned to acquire a minimum launch capability for all missiles that came its way, and it set about developing grou
1 CONC ps of trained military personnel to assemble, check out, prepare, launch and guide missiles assigned to AFMTC for testi
1 CONC ng purposes. For the MATADOR program, some of the 6555th Guided Missile Squadron's observers and reporters became the m
1 CONC embers of the initial MATADOR launch cadre, and they passed their training on to the first two operational MATADOR unit
1 CONC s -- the 1st and 69th Pilotless Bomber Squadrons (Light). This training included on-the-job factory training, missile a
1 CONC ssembly shop training, contractor and military instruction and simulated and real MATADOR launches.2
1 CONT MATADOR operations became a large part of the 6555th's mission in the early 1950s, but the Wing had to consider its oth
1 CONC er agencies and tasks as well. The 4803rd Guided Missile Squadron, for example, had been launching LARKS from Cape Cana
1 CONC veral since October 1950. That mission continued under the 6556th Guided Missile Squadron with the launch of two more L
1 CONC ARKS in June 1951. Detachment 1 also continued to support RAZON guided bomb tests at the Eglin Air Proving Ground throu
1 CONC gh the end of July 1951, and its 30 officers and men were transferred to Patrick for reassignment to other duties withi
1 CONC n the 6555th Guided Missile Wing in August 1951. The 6555th Test Support Squadron was activated on 4 September 1951 t
1 CONC o operate and maintain various types of "chase" planes and control aircraft being used to support the Wing's various gu
1 CONC ided missile projects. In addition to its LARK operations, the 6556th Guided Missile Squadron established a FALCON cadr
1 CONC e at Holloman Air Force Base on 31 March 1952. It also organized a RASCAL cadre at Patrick on 16 June 1952 and sent i
1 CONC t to Holloman. (Both cadres were transferred to the Holloman Air Development Center in early September 1952.) When th
1 CONC e 6555th Guided Missile Wing was redesignated as a Group on 1 March 1953, most of its headquarters functions were dropp
1 CONC ed, and the 6556th Guided Missile Squadron and 6555th Test Support Squadron were discontinued. Nevertheless, the 6555t
1 CONC h Guided Missile Wing continued to have many time-consuming tasks apart from MATADOR.3

1 CONT From its inception the 6555th Guided Missile Wing had a multi-faceted mission. As Wing Commander, Colonel George M. McN
1 CONC eese was responsible for: 1) organizing, supervising and conducting guided missile tests assigned to AFMTC, 2) developi
1 CONC ng handling techniques and tactics, 3) training cadres for tactical missile units, and 4) submitting reports on missil
1 CONC e research and development. Apart from the five officers and 25 airmen at Eglin, Colonel McNeese had 30 officers and 7
1 CONC 1 airmen working on various tasks at his Headquarters in June 1951. Fifty-two officers and 410 airmen were also assigne
1 CONC d to the 6555th's two squadrons during this period. The 6555th Guided Missile Squadron, with 33 officers and 284 airmen
1 CONC , was in training to assist the Glenn L. Martin Company with its MATADOR launch program. The Squadron also planned to c
1 CONC onduct operational suitability tests on the MATADOR and train the first two operational MATADOR squadrons (i.e., the 1s
1 CONC t and 69th Pilotless Bomber Squadrons), which were activated at Patrick in October 1951 and January 1952. The 6556th Gu
1 CONC ided Missile Squadron, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Henry B. Sayler, had 19 officers and 126 airmen involved in LAR
1 CONC K operations as a functional training exercise in anticipation of more advanced surface-to-air missile programs like th
1 CONC e BOMARC. With the creation of the 6555th Test Support Squadron on September 4th and the activation of the 1st Pilotles
1 CONC s Bomber Squadron on October 1st, the Wing had 119 officers, two warrant officers and 599 airmen assigned to its variou
1 CONC s operations by the end of October 1951. The Wing's strength increased rapidly after the 69th Pilotless Bomber Squadron
1 CONC 's activation on 11 January 1952. By the end of June 1952, Colonel McNeese had the following resources:4

1 CONT The MATADOR (B-61) program commanded most of the 6555th's attention during its first four years at Cape Canaveral, s
1 CONC o it is only fair to begin our review of the winged missiles with the MATADOR. Between 20 June 1951 and the end of Jun
1 CONC e 1952, 18 bright-red MATADOR "X" and "Y" experimental missiles were launched from Cape Canaveral by the Glenn L. Marti
1 CONC n Company and the 6555th. All but one of the launches validated the MATADOR's zero-length launcher. Nine of the flight
1 CONC s confirmed that the MATADOR's airframe was airworthy, and several of the later flights verified the usefulness of a co
1 CONC ntrol system prototype. The 6555th Guided Missile Squadron assisted the contractor in checking out and launching 16 o
1 CONC f those missiles, including Number 547, which was the first B-61 prepared and launched successfully by an all-militar
1 CONC y crew on 7 December 1951. Thus, by the time the 1st and 69th Pilotless Bomber Squadrons were ready to begin training i
1 CONC n 1952, the 6555th was prepared to provide that instruction.5

1 CONT MATADOR TRANSPORT TRAILER - 1953
1 CONT The 6555th's MATADOR training program was divided into three phases. During the first phase, personnel assigned to prop
1 CONC ulsion and missile assembly received 13 days of individual training, and individuals assigned to missile guidance wer
1 CONC e given 43 days of instruction. During the second phase, individual technicians were gathered into three distinct type
1 CONC s of teams (e.g., assembly, checkout or launch) to start working on a MATADOR missile. This phase normally took about s
1 CONC ix weeks, but lack of training missiles and ground equipment often conspired to make this phase of training longer. I
1 CONC n the third phase, guidance, propulsion and assembly teams were joined together as crews. Crew training was expected t
1 CONC o last 40 days, depending on the availability of training missiles. A final phase of training -- conducted by the squad
1 CONC rons themselves -- turned the crews into an operational squadron under its own staff officers and commander. During thi
1 CONC s final phase, the 6555th's instructors operated in an advisory capacity only.6
1 CONT With regard to the training actually conducted in 1952, the 1st Pilotless Bomber Squadron began its individual trainin
1 CONC g on 16 January 1952. Its team training in assembly, propulsion and controls started February 2nd and continued throug
1 CONC h March. (Crew training in those areas caught up with crew training in the guidance area in April.) During the crew pha
1 CONC se, missiles were assembled and checked out using assembly line procedures. Technicians checked engine systems and engi
1 CONC ne run-ups followed. The launch crew took over and completed a simulated launch of the missile. (Initially, training mi
1 CONC ssiles were provided by the 6555th, but the 1st Squadron received its first training missile -- Number 553 -- in June 1
1 CONC 952.) Due to its later activation date and a lack of training equipment, the 69th training on airborne guidance and fli
1 CONC ght control equipment, RATO equipment and missile engine systems until April 1952. Members of the 69th's launching sect
1 CONC ion faced even longer delays, and their individual training did not begin until early June. Both squadrons were "basica
1 CONC lly trained" by the end of 1952, but the lack of special squadron equipment and training launches stymied efforts to ma
1 CONC ke either squadron operational by an early date. Problems with the MATADOR's performance also delayed the deployment o
1 CONC f both squadrons.7
1 CONT At this point, we need to take a closer look at the MATADOR and its ground and flight support equipment. Early test ver
1 CONC sions of the MATADOR were slightly more than 34 feet long and 23 feet from wing-tip to wing-tip, but they evolved int
1 CONC o production models measuring 39.6 feet by 28.7 feet. In either configuration, the MATADOR could carry approximately 25
1 CONC 0 gallons of JP-3 jet fuel, and it weighed about as much as a jet fighter of comparable size. The missile's warhead com
1 CONC partment was designed to carry a 3,000-pound weapon, but it carried test equipment and ballast for the MATADOR's flight
1 CONC s from Cape Canaveral. The airframe was designed to handle the combined thrust of the missile's RATO solid rocket boost
1 CONC er and the Allison J-33-A-31 turbojet engine (i.e., 44,600 pounds of thrust). The wing and tail surfaces were aluminu
1 CONC m alloy shells reinforced with honeycomb cores. Spoilers provided lateral control, and the MATADOR's horizontal tail wa
1 CONC s mounted atop the vertical stabilizer to minimize buffeting at high sub-sonic speeds. The missile's zero-length launch
1 CONC er was a 20-ton flat-bed trailer equipped with a cradle to support the MATADOR and elevate the missile to a launching a
1 CONC ngle of 18 degrees. A transport trailer was used to carry the MATADOR and its wing as two separate pieces to be assembl
1 CONC ed at the launch site.8
1 CONT Two different guidance systems were under development for the MATADOR program in the early 1950s -- the SHANICLE and th
1 CONC e MARC. The SHANICLE (Short Range Navigation Vehicle) system consisted of a microwave pulsed hyperbolic network based o
1 CONC n principles applied in the common LORAN navigation system. The SHANICLE employed a pair of "master" and "slave" microw
1 CONC ave ground stations to generate an azimuth for the missile's flight to the target. It used a second pair of master/slav
1 CONC e stations to generate the distance to the target. The intersection of azimuth and distance hyperbolas defined the targ
1 CONC et. The master stations controlled timing, synchronized the microwave signals to the slave stations and (most important
1 CONC ly) transmitted guidance signals to the MATADOR as regular intervals during the flight. Once the missile reached its "t
1 CONC erminal dive" point near the target area, a signal was sent to precess the MATADOR's vertical gyro, and this action sen
1 CONC t the missile into a vertical dive toward the target.9
